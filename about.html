            This studio is run by true yoga lovers and highly skilled practitioners: Adam, Helen, and Michael.
        </p>

        <p>
            Encouraged by every existing temple in India and combining spiritual teachings with daily life, Adam and Helen dreamed of a place where they could 
            practice what inspired them and give all the students and yoga community transformative adventure with teaching scholars and yoga leaders of the 
            highest importance.
        </p>

            In 2008, their student Michael suggested his own dream of founding a yoga studio. So, the three were ready for changes and recognized that their 
            joint skills, expertise, and passion would let them turn their dream into reality. Our studio opened its doors in 2009.
