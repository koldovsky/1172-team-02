					<h3>Lucile Peterson</h3>
					<p>“Thanks to yoga classes at the Atta Yoga studio, I have become much calmer and more organized in
						my thoughts and actions. Yoga is a really good option for those who don't like the usual active
						gym workouts. I love my yoga classes at Atta!”</p>

					<h3>Ashley Parson</h3>
					<p>“Yoga is my path to a healthy and flexible body. I tried different sports, but they quickly tired
						me. Yoga helps me to be in good shape without exhausting physical exertion. In addition, I like
						the studio itself where classes are held and the coaches — very pleasant and polite people.”</p>
