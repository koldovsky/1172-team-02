                        have become much calmer and more organized in my thoughts and actions. Yoga is a really good
                        option for those who don't like the usual active gym workouts. I love my yoga classes at
                        Atta!”</p>

                        two years now. During this time, I have found many friends and like-minded people here. I like
                        that this is not just a yoga studio but a whole community that promotes a healthy approach to
                        mind, body, and life overall.”</p>

                        tried different sports, but they quickly tired me. Yoga helps me to be in good shape without
                        exhausting physical exertion. In addition, I like the studio itself where classes are held and
                        the coaches — very pleasant and polite people.”</p>
